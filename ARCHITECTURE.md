# SpiceMama — Technical Architecture and Repository Structure

## Architecture
Same-origin website at `https://spicemama.in`:

Browser (HTML/CSS/JS) -> `/api/v1/*` -> PHP 8.4 application -> PDO prepared statements -> MariaDB 10.11.
Admin uses secure same-origin PHP sessions and CSRF protection. Product photos served from a non-executable public uploads directory; upload processing/validation in PHP. No WordPress, Node server, Redis, Docker or long-running worker required on hosting.

## Repository (source, NOT a literal public_html mirror)

## Production layout (illustrative, verify with Webuzo)
```
/home/spicemam/
├── app/                     # PRIVATE: backend/src, config, vendor, env, logs
├── releases/                # optional versioned release directories, PRIVATE
├── storage-private/         # PRIVATE: temporary/quarantined uploads, logs
└── public_html/             # PUBLIC document root
    ├── index.html
    ├── products.html
    ├── product.html
    ├── about.html
    ├── contact.html
    ├── admin/               # admin UI files, API must enforce auth
    ├── assets/
    ├── uploads/products/    # images only, PHP execution disabled
    ├── api/index.php        # public PHP entry point requiring private app
    └── .htaccess
```
Actual PHP include paths and rewrite rules must be tested on Webuzo before release. Do not put `.env`, `vendor`, SQL dumps, Git metadata or source/config files under public_html. Admin HTML being accessible is not itself security; API endpoints enforce sessions/roles.

## Hosting observations from owner-supplied inspection
PHP 8.4 active; PDO MySQL/MySQLi, cURL, OpenSSL, mbstring, GD, Imagick, intl, ZIP, OPcache enabled; fileinfo unconfirmed. PHP memory 64 MB; max execution 30 s; max input 60 s; max input vars 1000. MariaDB 10.11; no DB yet. `upload_max_filesize=20M`, `post_max_size=8M` => effective multipart upload must be below 8 MB including overhead. SSL installed but certificate validity/renewal unverified; Force HTTPS OFF. Backuply one restore point observed 2026-10-22; schedule/retention unknown. Git cloning supported, auto deployment unverified. Hosting disk quota advertised 25 GB vs panel unlimited; bandwidth ~976.56 GiB; CPU/RAM/I/O limits unknown.

## Architecture rules
- Use same-origin `/api/v1` to avoid CORS complexity.
- Keep a versioned API specification; change it only by agreement of both developers.
- All public product queries must return only published records; drafts are never publicly retrievable.
- No browser access to DB credentials or private server files.
- Do not rely on client-side validation for security.
- No PHP execution from uploads; random server-generated filenames; validate MIME by content, decode and re-encode where feasible, bound dimensions/size; verify fileinfo and GD/Imagick behavior.
- Use password_hash/password_verify, session regeneration at login, secure HttpOnly SameSite cookies on HTTPS, CSRF tokens for admin mutations, login throttling and server-side permissions.
- Use PDO bound parameters, output encoding, security headers, restrictive file permissions and minimal database privileges.
- Store all timestamps in UTC, render in user locale. Use utf8mb4.
- Future e-commerce must have server-side price calculations, signed payment webhooks, idempotent order transitions and audited stock changes. Not implemented in v1.

## Approved foundation update

Root Images/ contains 16 original assets and remains unchanged. Separately named
web derivatives may live in frontend/assets/images; keep source mapping. The
root API_CONTRACT.yaml is authoritative; do not create a contracts/ duplicate.
frontend/dev/ is for mocks only and excluded from releases. Listed application
files are future targets: scaffolding does not implement PHP or frontend pages.
See docs/integration.md and docs/database-migration-spec.md for v1 semantics and
proposed operational tables. Public products also require an active category.
Primary image is the first gallery item. Product deletion uses archive status.
Application upload limit is 5,242,880 bytes, subject to stricter server limits.
Shared contract changes need owner approval and coordinated developer review.
